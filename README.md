# Seeds of Life

See [maker-of-life](https://github.com/maker-of-life)'s contribution graph for the current state of the world. The state updates every 30 minutes.

To seed life, open an issue in this repository containing the list of dates to seed life on, separated by newlines. [maker-of-life](https://github.com/maker-of-life) will then close the issue and create life.

*Important!* Issues with the functionality should be submitted to the [source repository](https://github.com/erbridge/life-maker), not this repository.
